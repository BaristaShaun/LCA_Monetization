# Monetizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Results

"""
This project focuses on monetizing environmental impacts derived from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results.
By assigning monetary values to various environmental impacts, stakeholders can evaluate and compare them 
across categories on a single common scale. The program provides an interactive GUI for:

1. **Data Input**: Users input values for environmental impacts through an intuitive GUI.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The application multiplies the input values by user-selected cost factors 
   (Minimum, Maximum, or Average).
3. **Visualization**: A vertical stacked bar chart shows the total monetized environmental impact 
   and the relative contribution of each category.

# Why is this Important?
- **Holistic Comparisons**: Monetizing LCA results allows for a comprehensive comparison across all 
  impact categories, not just Global Warming Potential (GWP). This facilitates a more complete 
  understanding of a product's environmental footprint.

- **Simplified Decision-Making**: Converting environmental impacts into monetary terms enables 
  easier comparisons between scenarios or product lines. Stakeholders can discern the relative 
  sustainability of various options, aiding strategic planning.

- **Scenario Analysis**: By evaluating the externalities associated with different installation methods, 
  e.g., Direct Air Capture (DAC) plants in various countries, decision-makers can identify the most 
  sustainable option with minimal environmental impact.

# Features

1. **Data Input**: Users input values for environmental impacts through an intuitive GUI.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The application multiplies the input values by user-selected cost factors 
   (Minimum, Maximum, or Average).
3. **Visualization**: A vertical stacked bar chart shows the total monetized environmental impact 
   and the relative contribution of each category.

# How to Use
### 1. Input Data:
- Enter values for each environmental impact category using the provided GUI.

### 2. Select Cost Factor:
- Choose between Minimum, Maximum, or Average cost factors to calculate costs.

### 3. View Results:
- Review the calculated costs in the GUI table.

### 4. Visualization
The stacked bar chart provides:
- **Total Impact**: The overall monetized environmental cost.
- **Category Contributions**: Each environmental impact's contribution is represented by a segment in the bar
